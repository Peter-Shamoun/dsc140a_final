# Building a Spanish-French Word Classifier: A Comprehensive Analysis

The assignment for DSC 140A involves developing a machine learning classifier to distinguish between Spanish and French words without using pre-built machine learning libraries. This research report provides a thorough analysis of approaches to solve this text classification problem, focusing on feature engineering techniques and appropriate classification algorithms covered in the course. By implementing effective techniques from scratch, we can create a robust classifier that meets or exceeds the target accuracy of 75%.

## Understanding the Task and Dataset Characteristics

The fundamental task involves classifying individual words as either Spanish or French based solely on their character patterns and statistical features. According to the assignment description, the dataset contains 1200 words split approximately evenly between Spanish and French, with text derived from translations of common English phrases. The data has been preprocessed to remove accents and special characters, which simplifies the classification task but also removes some distinctive language features[^1].

Language identification at the word level presents unique challenges compared to document-level classification. Individual words contain limited information compared to full sentences or paragraphs, requiring careful feature selection to capture subtle linguistic differences. Words in Spanish and French share many similarities due to their common Latin roots, but they also exhibit distinctive orthographic patterns that can be leveraged for classification[^7].

The implementation constraints require building the classifier from scratch using only NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, and standard Python libraries. This aligns with the course's focus on understanding the fundamentals of machine learning algorithms rather than simply applying pre-built solutions[^2].

## Feature Engineering for Language Identification

Feature engineering represents the most critical aspect of building an effective language classifier. Based on linguistic differences between Spanish and French, several feature extraction approaches can be effective for this task.

### Character-Level Features

Character frequency analysis provides a strong baseline for language identification. Spanish and French have different distributions of character usage - for instance, 'j' and 'ñ' appear frequently in Spanish while 'q', 'w', and certain combinations like 'oi' are more common in French. By counting the occurrences of each character in a word and normalizing by word length, we create a feature vector that captures these distributional differences[^4][^6].

Character n-grams extend this approach by considering sequences of adjacent characters. As shown in search result[^4], the CountVectorizer approach with ngram_range=(1, 2) can capture both individual characters (unigrams) and character pairs (bigrams). For our implementation, we would need to create this functionality from scratch rather than using the CountVectorizer class. The algorithm would involve creating a dictionary of all possible character unigrams and bigrams in the training data, then counting their occurrences in each word to create feature vectors[^4].

### Morphological Features

Word endings (suffixes) often provide strong signals for language identification. Spanish words frequently end in patterns like '-ar', '-er', '-ir', '-dad', and '-ción', while French words commonly end with '-eau', '-eux', '-ier', and '-ment'. Extracting the last 2-3 characters of each word as features can capture these morphological differences[^8].

Similarly, prefixes and certain intra-word character combinations can be distinctive. For example, Spanish rarely uses double consonants except for 'll' and 'rr', while French frequently uses double consonants like 'mm', 'nn', and 'tt'. Detecting these patterns can enhance classification accuracy[^6].

### Statistical Features

Word length itself can be a useful feature, as languages tend to have different average word lengths. Additionally, the ratio of vowels to consonants and the frequency of certain character combinations can distinguish between languages. These statistical features complement the character-level and morphological features[^8].

## Machine Learning Models for Text Classification

Several machine learning algorithms covered in DSC 140A are appropriate for this language classification task. Each offers distinct advantages and implementation considerations.

### Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes represents an excellent choice for text classification tasks due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness with high-dimensional, sparse feature spaces. The model works by applying Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of conditional independence between features[^3][^9].

For our task, a Multinomial Naive Bayes would be most appropriate since we're dealing with frequency counts of character features. The implementation would involve:

1. Calculating prior probabilities for each language class based on their frequency in the training data
2. Computing the conditional probability of each feature given each language class
3. Using Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of each language given a new word's features
4. Classifying the word based on the highest posterior probability

As shown in search result[^3], a Gaussian Naive Bayes implementation requires calculating means and variances for each feature in each class. For character-based features, we would adapt this to use the multinomial distribution instead[^3].

### K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm offers another viable approach to language classification. KNN works by finding the K training examples closest to a new word in the feature space, then classifying based on the majority class among these neighbors[^8].

For text classification using KNN, we would:

1. Convert all words to feature vectors using the techniques described above
2. Define a distance metric (typically Euclidean or cosine similarity) to measure similarity between word vectors
3. For each test word, find the K nearest training words
4. Assign the most common class among these K neighbors

The primary advantage of KNN is its simplicity and lack of training time. However, the classification process can be slower as it requires comparing each test word with all training words. The choice of K and the distance metric significantly impacts performance[^8].

### Perceptron Classifier

The perceptron represents the simplest form of a neural network and can be effective for linearly separable classification problems. As demonstrated in search result[^5], a perceptron-based text classifier can be implemented by:

1. Converting words to feature vectors
2. Initializing weights randomly
3. For each training example, computing the predicted class and updating weights if the prediction is incorrect
4. Repeating the weight updates for multiple iterations
5. Classifying new words based on the dot product with the learned weights

The perceptron has the advantage of being simple to implement while potentially offering good performance if the classes are reasonably separable in the feature space[^5].

### Support Vector Machines

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have been covered in Week 4 of the course and could be implemented for this classification task. A linear SVM would find the hyperplane that best separates Spanish and French words in the feature space, maximizing the margin between the two classes[^1].

Implementing an SVM from scratch is more complex than the other options, involving:

1. Formulating and solving the quadratic programming problem to find support vectors
2. Computing the decision boundary
3. Using the kernel trick if needed for non-linear separation

While powerful, the complexity of implementing SVMs from scratch makes this a more challenging option for this assignment[^1].

## Implementation Strategy

Based on the analysis of feature engineering techniques and classification models, a Naive Bayes approach with character n-gram features represents the most promising implementation strategy for achieving the target accuracy while remaining reasonably simple to implement.

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing phase would consist of:

1. Loading the training data (train_words and train_labels)
2. Converting all words to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity
3. Creating a vocabulary of character unigrams and bigrams from the training data
4. Converting each word into a feature vector based on this vocabulary

This preprocessing step is critical for creating useful representations of words for the classification model[^4][^7].

### Feature Extraction Implementation

The feature extraction would involve creating a function that:

1. Extracts all possible character unigrams and bigrams from the training data
2. Builds a dictionary mapping each n-gram to an index in the feature vector
3. For each word, constructs a feature vector by counting the occurrences of each n-gram

Additional features like word endings, specific character combinations, and statistical measures would complement the n-gram features[^4][^6].

```python
def extract_features(word, ngram_dict):
    features = np.zeros(len(ngram_dict))
    
    # Add unigram features
    for char in word:
        if char in ngram_dict:
            features[ngram_dict[char]] += 1
    
    # Add bigram features
    for i in range(len(word)-1):
        bigram = word[i:i+2]
        if bigram in ngram_dict:
            features[ngram_dict[bigram]] += 1
    
    # Add suffix features
    if len(word) >= 3:
        suffix = word[-3:]
        if suffix in ngram_dict:
            features[ngram_dict[suffix]] += 1
            
    # Normalize features by word length for better comparison
    features = features / max(len(word), 1)
    
    return features
```


### Naive Bayes Implementation

The Naive Bayes implementation would include:

1. A function to compute class priors and feature likelihoods from training data
2. A classification function that applies Bayes' theorem to compute posterior probabilities
3. A prediction function that selects the class with the highest posterior probability

To prevent numerical underflow with multiplication of many small probabilities, we would use log probabilities as shown in the perceptron example in search result[^3][^9].

```python
def train_naive_bayes(features, labels):
    classes = np.unique(labels)
    class_priors = {}
    feature_likelihoods = {}
    
    for c in classes:
        # Calculate class priors
        class_features = features[labels == c]
        class_priors[c] = len(class_features) / len(features)
        
        # Calculate feature likelihoods with Laplace smoothing
        feature_counts = np.sum(class_features, axis=0) + 1  # Add 1 for Laplace smoothing
        total_counts = np.sum(feature_counts)
        feature_likelihoods[c] = feature_counts / total_counts
    
    return class_priors, feature_likelihoods
```


### Handling Overfitting

To address the risk of overfitting mentioned in the assignment, several strategies should be implemented:

1. Laplace (add-one) smoothing for Naive Bayes to handle unseen features
2. Feature selection to retain only the most informative features
3. Cross-validation on the training data to estimate model performance
4. Regularization techniques appropriate to the chosen model

These approaches would help ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen test data rather than memorizing the training examples[^7][^9].

## Cross-Validation and Performance Evaluation

Before submitting the final implementation, it's essential to evaluate model performance using cross-validation on the training data. This provides an estimate of how well the model will perform on the unseen test data.

A k-fold cross-validation approach would involve:

1. Splitting the training data into k folds
2. For each fold, training the model on the remaining k-1 folds and evaluating on the held-out fold
3. Averaging the performance across all k folds to get an estimate of test performance

This process helps identify potential overfitting issues and allows for comparison of different feature sets and model hyperparameters[^2][^7].

## Conclusion

Building an effective Spanish-French word classifier requires careful feature engineering to capture the distinctive patterns in each language. Character n-grams, word endings, and specific character combinations provide strong signals for language identification. Among the machine learning models covered in DSC 140A, Naive Bayes represents the most promising approach due to its effectiveness for text classification, simplicity of implementation, and computational efficiency.

With proper feature engineering and implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier, achieving the target accuracy of 75% is feasible. By applying cross-validation and techniques to prevent overfitting, the model can potentially exceed 80% accuracy on the unseen test data, earning extra credit. The assignment presents an excellent opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge from the course to a practical machine learning task, implementing a classifier from scratch that performs effectively on real-world data.

## Advanced Feature Engineering and Implementation Considerations

### Position-Specific Character Patterns

While the basic character n-gram approach provides a good foundation, the position of character patterns within words carries significant discriminative power for language identification. Spanish and French exhibit distinct patterns at word beginnings, endings, and internal positions.

For word beginnings:
- French commonly starts with 'ph-', 'th-', 'ch-' (Greek influence)
- Spanish frequently begins with 'es-' before consonants

For word endings:
- French: '-eux', '-eau', '-ier', '-ment', '-tion'
- Spanish: '-ción', '-dad', '-aje', '-mente'

Internal patterns:
- French double consonants: 'mm', 'nn', 'tt', 'ss'
- Spanish specific: 'll', 'rr', 'ñ'

### Vowel Pattern Analysis

The distribution and combination of vowels provide strong signals for language identification:

1. **Consecutive Vowel Patterns**:
   - French: 'eu', 'ou', 'ai', 'oi', 'eau'
   - Spanish: 'ue', 'ie', 'ua', 'io'

2. **Vowel-Consonant Ratios**:
   - Spanish tends to have a higher vowel-to-consonant ratio
   - French often has more complex consonant clusters

3. **Position-specific Vowel Combinations**:
   - Word-final vowels are more common in Spanish
   - French often ends in consonants or silent 'e'

### Implementation Efficiency Considerations

To ensure efficient processing of the feature space while maintaining accuracy:

1. **Sparse Feature Representation**:
```python
def create_sparse_features(word, feature_dict):
    features = {}  # Use dictionary for sparse representation
    for i in range(len(word)-1):
        ngram = word[i:i+2]
        if ngram in feature_dict:
            features[feature_dict[ngram]] = 1
    return features
```

2. **Feature Selection with Information Gain**:
```python
def calculate_information_gain(feature_vector, labels):
    total_entropy = calculate_entropy(labels)
    feature_entropy = 0
    for value in set(feature_vector):
        subset_labels = labels[feature_vector == value]
        feature_entropy += len(subset_labels)/len(labels) * calculate_entropy(subset_labels)
    return total_entropy - feature_entropy
```

### Model Performance Optimization

#### Naive Bayes Enhancements

The basic Naive Bayes implementation can be improved with:

1. **Log Probability Computation**:
```python
def compute_log_probabilities(features, labels):
    log_probs = {}
    for label in set(labels):
        class_features = features[labels == label]
        # Add smoothing constant to prevent log(0)
        feature_counts = np.sum(class_features, axis=0) + 1
        total_counts = np.sum(feature_counts)
        log_probs[label] = np.log(feature_counts/total_counts)
    return log_probs
```

2. **Feature Weighting**:
- Weight position-specific features more heavily
- Apply TF-IDF-like weighting to n-grams

#### KNN Optimization

For efficient KNN implementation:

1. **Ball Tree Structure**:
```python
class BallTreeNode:
    def __init__(self, points, indices):
        self.points = points
        self.indices = indices
        if len(indices) > 10:  # Non-leaf node
            self.split_dim = np.argmax(np.var(points[indices], axis=0))
            median = np.median(points[indices, self.split_dim])
            left_idx = indices[points[indices, self.split_dim] <= median]
            right_idx = indices[points[indices, self.split_dim] > median]
            self.left = BallTreeNode(points, left_idx)
            self.right = BallTreeNode(points, right_idx)
```

2. **Distance Computation Optimization**:
- Cache frequently computed distances
- Use squared Euclidean distance to avoid square root computation

### Handling Edge Cases and Ambiguity

#### Short Word Strategy
For words with length ≤ 3 characters:

1. Maintain frequency dictionaries of short words in each language
2. Use position-specific character probabilities
3. Apply special weighting for short word features

```python
def classify_short_word(word, short_word_stats):
    if len(word) <= 3:
        # Use special short word classification logic
        spanish_prob = short_word_stats['spanish'].get(word, 0.1)
        french_prob = short_word_stats['french'].get(word, 0.1)
        return 'spanish' if spanish_prob > french_prob else 'french'
```

#### Ambiguous Words
For words that could belong to either language:

1. **Ensemble Approach**:
```python
def ensemble_classify(word, classifiers):
    votes = []
    for clf in classifiers:
        pred = clf.predict(extract_features(word))
        votes.append(pred)
    return max(set(votes), key=votes.count)
```

2. **Confidence Thresholding**:
- Only make high-confidence predictions
- Flag low-confidence cases for special handling

### Performance Evaluation Framework

#### Cross-Validation Strategy

Implement stratified k-fold cross-validation:

```python
def stratified_kfold_cv(X, y, k=5):
    # Ensure balanced class distribution in each fold
    fold_indices = []
    for label in set(y):
        label_indices = np.where(y == label)[0]
        np.random.shuffle(label_indices)
        fold_size = len(label_indices) // k
        for i in range(k):
            fold_indices.append(label_indices[i*fold_size:(i+1)*fold_size])
    return fold_indices
```

#### Learning Curves
Monitor training and validation performance:

```python
def plot_learning_curves(train_sizes, train_scores, val_scores):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(train_sizes, train_scores, 'o-', label='Training score')
    plt.plot(train_sizes, val_scores, 'o-', label='Cross-validation score')
    plt.xlabel('Training examples')
    plt.ylabel('Score')
    plt.title('Learning Curves')
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.legend(loc='best')
```

### Memory and Computational Complexity

For a dataset with n training examples and m features:

1. **Feature Extraction**:
- Time complexity: O(nL) where L is max word length
- Space complexity: O(m) for feature dictionary

2. **Model Training**:
- Naive Bayes: O(nm) time, O(m) space
- KNN with Ball Tree: O(n log n) construction, O(n) space

3. **Prediction**:
